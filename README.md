## YGaming - Launcher

This is the official Repository for the **YGaming Launcher**.
For now it's being used to only simplify the download and install of my [YideSpace](https://github.com/WhyGaming/YideSpace) Project.
> In the future we wanna make some other games available for you.

## Installation

As with **YideSpace**, there is no official download link provided for the time being.
Of yourse you can clone this repo and help me developing this project.
## Contact

To get in contact with me, you can join the official **YGaming** [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rbAfUKyqxr).
There you get an overview of what I'm currently working on and maybe also get in contact with other developers.
For now my community is small which has many pros and cons. But I'm happy when someone has interest in my stuff.
